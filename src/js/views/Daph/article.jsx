					Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
					typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
					industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
					when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
					it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
					five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
					remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
					with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
					and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
					PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
